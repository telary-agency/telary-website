### Talk to Airflow — Build an AI Agent Using PydanticAI and Gemini 2.0

The blog post delves into the journey of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into production systems, likening the experience to the early days of aviation where pilots relied heavily on experience and intuition due to minimal instrumentation. The author highlights the challenges in AI development, noting that despite having powerful models like Gemini 2.0, utilizing this power for production-grade applications often feels like navigating without proper tools. The post introduces PydanticAI, a framework designed to bring control and reliability to agent systems, comparing it to a modern aircraft cockpit that combines various controls into one coherent interface.

The author emphasizes the simplicity and intuitiveness of PydanticAI, drawing parallels to their first experience with FastAPI. They highlight the key features of PydanticAI, including its deep integration with Pydantic's ecosystem, type safety, familiar patterns for FastAPI developers, and production-ready design. The framework is model-agnostic, supports built-in dependency injection for testing, and offers seamless Logfire integration for real-time monitoring. The post also touches on the future of PydanticAI, noting its growing ecosystem integration and focus on developer experience.

The core of the blog post is a tutorial on building an AI agent using PydanticAI to interact with Apache Airflow. The author walks through setting up a local Airflow environment, creating sample DAGs, and implementing the AI agent with PydanticAI. The agent is designed to understand natural language queries about workflows, fetch real-time status updates, and respond with structured, reliable data. The tutorial includes detailed code snippets and explanations, showcasing how to define dependencies, output models, and tool functions. The author also discusses the importance of async operations in making the application more efficient.

The post concludes with a demo of the AI agent in action, showing how it handles a user request to check the status of a DAG for a daily payment report. The author highlights the potential of such an agent in real-world scenarios, such as autonomously finding related DAGs and engaging in conversations with users. The blog post emphasizes that with the right tools and frameworks, building production-grade AI applications can be straightforward and reliable, likening it to modern air travel. This article is the featured one of our newsletter because it provides an in-depth, practical guide to leveraging advanced AI frameworks for real-world applications. The tutorial on integrating PydanticAI with Apache Airflow offers valuable insights into how AI can enhance workflow management, making it a must-read for anyone interested in the intersection of AI and data engineering.
