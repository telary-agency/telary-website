### Data News — Week 24.37

The featured blog post for our newsletter is a comprehensive roundup of the latest developments in the data and AI worlds, providing a blend of personal updates, industry news, and insightful commentary. The author begins by expressing their surprise at the rapid passage of time, highlighting their focus on an upcoming journey, which they plan to announce fully in the coming week. This personal touch adds a layer of anticipation and engagement for the readers.

The article then dives into significant updates from the AI sphere, particularly focusing on OpenAI's new models, o1-preview and o1-mini. These models mark a significant shift, as OpenAI has decided to move away from the GPT naming convention, indicating a change in paradigm. The o1 series is noted for its enhanced "reasoning" capabilities, which the author describes as a pre-prompt that performs a chain of thoughts. This is exemplified by the model's ability to understand and navigate a failing Docker environment during a cybersecurity challenge. The author also emphasizes the importance of understanding that while the model processes information, it does not "think" in the human sense.

The blog post continues with more news about OpenAI, including the availability of new models on Azure and the release of Phi-3.5-mini by Microsoft. It also mentions Ilya Sutskever's new venture, Safe Superintelligence, and Alexis Conneau's new company, both of which have garnered significant attention. Additionally, the article discusses OpenAI's potential raise of $11.5 billion at a $150 billion valuation, making it the third most valuable private company. The impressive capabilities of NEO Beta, a humanoid company backed by OpenAI, are also highlighted.

The article then delves into AI models from other companies. Nvidia's Eagle, a vision-centric multimodal LLM, is noted for its ability to describe images and answer questions based on visual input. Aleph Alpha's Pharia-1-LLM is introduced as a 7B model targeted for non-commercial and research uses, marking Aleph Alpha's pivot to becoming an AI-support company for the public sector.

The blog post also covers various fast news items, such as the EU and China launching a cross-border data flow communication mechanism and practical guides on building analytics stacks, implementing daily caches, and automating data pipeline monitoring. The article touches on the evolving role of data science in sports, particularly in the UK football scene, and Spotify's diverse data science personas.

The detailed and diverse content of this article makes it the featured piece for our newsletter. It provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in the AI and data worlds, offering readers a mix of personal insights, technical updates, and industry news. The article's breadth and depth make it an invaluable resource for anyone interested in staying up-to-date with the rapidly evolving landscape of data and AI.
