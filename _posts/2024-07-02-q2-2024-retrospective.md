This is the end of the second quarter for Telary.

Some exciting projects, I talked about at the end of Q1, didn't start sadly but there are some good news.

Using the network of CTOs from CO-CTOs I did an audit and started working on a SQL oriented project for a new client.

This summer my work for one of my biggest client will be finished, the data platform works, and the team is fully autonomous, I don't think there are any blockers left so we decided to end it. It's cool to see that there is a way to finish a contact, even if the data platform is something always evolving we reached a point where there is not so much incertinity.

The good news is that I continued increasing the diversification of my turnover, all is not visible in this chart due to billing reasons, it should be better next quarter.
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/07/image-1.png)Biggest client turnover went from 74 to 65%, and should be around 45% at end of July
Regarding the tasks I did:
👉 Mostly quotes, and sales documents, I start to get fairly efficient and think my quotes are impactful
👉 Some Data Engineering Databricks, Snowflake and an entire mission around SQL
👉 Some DataOps work on AWS with Terraform…
👉 Some Ops stuff, with Ansible to deploy on OVH
👉 Some Software Engineering experiments with HTMX and Django probably described in another post

**🐓 Overall 🐓** : I expected Q2 to grow faster because the end of Q1 was very intense but some potential contract fell through, but we're still on a good trajectory.

I also built a chicken coop and I now have 2 chickens, and fresh eggs hidden in stinging nettles every morning.
