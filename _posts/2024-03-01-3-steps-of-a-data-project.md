For several years we built data platforms at Telary following the same recipe. It was efficient, cost-effective, and fast. But for some clients, the upfront costs were a bit too high and led to long decision-making processes.

## Co-create & Design

The first step is called co-create & design. This is where we try to understand your issues, what you plan to solve with your data platform, and a simple way to test that it works for you.

In short, the actions are:

- We discuss your needs
- We find solutions
- We design a proof of concept or a minimum viable product

When we are done, you will receive detailed architecture & design documentation. It depends on your needs, but most of the time it includes at least a detailed explanation of what we will do, the content of the next steps, the costs (people and infrastructure), and a roadmap. Usually, it takes 2 weeks.

To summarize:

📅 Around 2 weeks / part time

🎯 Define the "WHY" & the "HOW"

📦 Detailed architecture & design documentation

## Setup & Deploy

Once the first step is done, we start the second. The goal is to quickly deploy the previously defined MVP and ensure that it suits your needs and matches the expected return on investment.

The actions are:

- We start deploying the data platform
- You start experimenting with it
- Confirm that we solve an impactful pain point

This part takes longer, but you will regularly see demos of work in progress. It also lets us adjust our trajectory and reassess priorities if needed. We try to iterate with the shortest feedback loop possible.

📅 Between 1 and 3 months / full time or part time

🎯 Build the platform & confirm the need

📦 A working POC/MVP of your data platform

## Make it your own

Now that you have received your data platform, you will start using it and probably ask for some quick changes and customizations. A few paths are open to us: start building your team, increase the scope of the data platform, fiddle with AI... The good news is that we can help with all of that.

Some examples of our recent actions:

- Hiring your team members
- Improving ease of maintenance
- Ensuring that everything is running as expected
- Developing the first new features

The end goal is to ensure you have everything you need so you are not reliant on us.

📅 Whatever is necessary / part time

🎯 Make the product reliable and the team ready

📦 A well-sized and autonomous team


Following these 3 steps, we have deployed dozens of data platforms for different kinds of organizations, mostly startups.
