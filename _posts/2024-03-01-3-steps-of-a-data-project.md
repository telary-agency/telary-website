For several years we built data platform at Telary following the same recipe, it was efficient, cost-effective and fast. But we had some issues with some of our clients were the upfront costs were a bit too high and lead to long decisions taking processes.

## Co-create & Design

The first step is named co-create & design, this is the part where we will try to understand what are your issues, what do you plan to solve with your data platform, and what would be a simple way to test that it works for you.

Globally the actions are:

- We discuss your need
- Find some solutions
- Design a proof of concept or the minimum viable product

When you are done, you will receive a detailed architecture & design documentation, it depends on your need but most of the time it includes at least a detailed explanation of what we will do, the content of the next steps, the cost (man and infrastructure), and a roadmap. Usually it takes 2 weeks.

To summarize:

📅 Around 2 weeks / part time

🎯 Define the "WHY" & the "HOW"

📦 Detailed architecture & design documentation

## Setup & Deploy

Once the first step is done, we start the second one, the goal for this one is to quickly deploy the MVP previously defined and ensure that it suits your need and match the expected return on investment.

The actions are:

- We start deploying the data platform
- You start experimenting with it
- Confirm that we solve an impacting pain-point

This part take longer but you will regularly see some demos of the work in progress, this is also a way for us to adjust our trajectory and reassess priorities if needed. We try to iterate with the shortest feedback loop possible.

📅 Between 1 and 3 months / full time or part time

🎯 Build the platform & confirm the need

📦 A working POC/MVP of your data platform

## Make it your own

Now that you received your data platform, you will start using it, and probably ask for some quick changes and customization. A few paths are opened for us, start building your team, increasing the scope of the data platform, fiddle with AI... The good news is that we can help you for all of that.

Some examples of our last actions:

- Hiring your team members
- Improving ease of maintenance
- Ensuring that everything is running as expected
- Developing first new features

The end goal is to ensure you have all the things you need to not be reliant on us.

📅 Whatever is necessary / part time

🎯 Make the product reliable and the team ready

📦 A well sized and autonomous team


Following the 3 steps we managed to deploy dozens of data platform for different kinds of organisations but mostly startups.
