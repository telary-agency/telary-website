It’s the end of a rich first quarter for Telary.

I hope that the next one will be better (spoiler it looks like it)

The start of the year was composed of a lot of administrative stuff, company creation, accounting… I had to close my solo company to open a "real" one. (From auto-entreprise to SASU for the frenchies)

I met 2 cool guys to help me prospecting with [LeadLeadBangBang](https://www.linkedin.com/company/leadleadbangbang/), [Xavier COIFFARD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xaviercoiffard/) & [Mehdi BOUAZIZ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bouaziz-mehdi/), we also share a common interest in remote work and future of work, that’s how we met.

Regarding numbers:

👉 I did a total of 8️⃣ first free calls, to discover new clients and explore new opportunities.
👉 Contracted with 3️⃣ clients for this quarter
👉 Found 3️⃣ awesome business partners

→ [CO-CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/co-cto/) - we started working together in the end of 2023

→ [LeadLeadBangBang](https://www.linkedin.com/company/leadleadbangbang/) - as I explained before

→ DazzStudio - it's always cool to be able to rely on more experienced partners for some topics like ML & AI

What I did:
👉 A lot of documentation, being technical or quotes. I like to polish this part of my work so it takes time but it avoids unpleasant discussions at a later time.
👉 Some Data Engineering Databricks, Snowflake.
👉 Some DataOps work on AWS, Terraform…

**Overall:** I’m fairly satisfied with this new way of doing consulting. I discovered I really liked the first few calls with a client trying to understand their needs, their vision on tech and how we could reach our goal together.

Regarding my turnover I still have one big client and a big dependency to it but I'm starting to diversify. That's probably the thing I should try to tackle first.
